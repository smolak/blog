**UPDATE** See the end of the post, for an update.

While working on [MySQL adapter for stash-it](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/mysql-adapter), I stumbled upon a problem of having a MySQL instance not being ready
on time to run tests against it. Well... it was a right time to to put the DevOps hat on and do some hacking.

But let me explain the findings and how I got to solve it step by step.

### Setting up dockerized MySQL

First of all, I wanted to have MySQL run inside a docker container. For that I prepared the docker-compose.yaml file:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: dbname
    ports:
      - '3306:3306'
```

Nothing fancy. A quick run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

and after a few moments, the DB is was and running. So far, so good.

### Running the tests

As the project is Node-based, I thought that this will work (part of package.json contents):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "docker compose up -d && vitest run && docker compose kill && docker compose rm -f"
  }
}
```

A quick explanation:

1. `docker compose up -d` starts MySQL container in detached mode
1. `vitest run` runs my tests (that connect to the DB, perform tasks, etc.)
1. `docker compose kill` immediately stops all running containers (in the context of where the script is executed, in this case, it's what was defined in docker-compose.yaml file)
1. `docker compose rm -f` forcefully removes stopped containers.

Basically the 2 last steps are a cleanup after the tests run.

Going back to running the tests. When I executed the script:

```sh
pnpm test
```

I got a nasty error when my code wanted to connect to the DB, but the connection was not possible.

What was going on? Simple - the DB was not ready yet to be interacted with.

### Waiting for the DB to be up and running

In order to know that the DB is ready, I had to come up with a method that:

1. Starts the container
1. Checks if it is ready
1. Runs the tests
1. Cleans up after everything's done

So, I created this script (with a bit of help from ChatGPT).
I added some echo statements to visualize the progress.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting MySQL using docker-compose..."
docker-compose up -d mysql

echo "Waiting for MySQL to be ready..."
MYSQL_HOST="localhost"       # I knew I would run this only locally
MYSQL_PORT="3306"            # Using the port from docker-compose.yaml
RETRIES=30                   # Maximum retries before giving up
SLEEP_TIME=2                 # Time to wait between retries

for ((i=1; i<=RETRIES; i++)); do
    if nc -z "$MYSQL_HOST" "$MYSQL_PORT"; then
        echo "MySQL is ready!"

        echo "Running tests..."
        vitest run

        echo "Cleaning up Docker containers..."
        docker-compose kill
        docker-compose rm -f
        exit 0
    else
        echo "MySQL is not ready yet. Retrying in $SLEEP_TIME seconds... ($i/$RETRIES)"
        sleep $SLEEP_TIME
    fi
done

# If we reach here, the database never became ready
echo "MySQL did not become ready in time. Cleaning up Docker and exiting."
docker-compose kill
docker-compose rm -f
exit 1
```

The new thing here is `nc -z "$MYSQL_HOST" "$MYSQL_PORT"`.

The `nc` (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.
In other words, I wanted to check if, for given host and port, my DB is ready.

Nice... right? (well, no, but later about that)

I saved the file, made it executable `chmod +x run-tests-with-cleanup.sh`, attached it to the `test` script

```json
"test": "./run-tests-with-cleanup.sh"
```

and run:

```sh
pnpm test
```

And I got the same error ðŸ˜‚

What was it this time? The same thing. Only this time we reached the point when the MySQL server was listening,
but the DB was still not yet ready.

### Wait, hodl it!

A naive approach was to wait some arbitrary time, so I did this:

```sh
if nc -z "$MYSQL_HOST" "$MYSQL_PORT"; then
  # Give it a few more seconds to be ready
  sleep 3
```

But it turned out not to be deterministic. One time it was enough, the other time it was not.
I had to come up with a better check in the `if` clause.

### DB, are you there?

The simplest solution was to connect to the DB directly and perform a query on it. If it responded with a non error response,
then all's good.

I updated the script, adding:

```sh
MYSQL_PASSWORD="rootpassword"
```

and changing the `if` clasuse to this:

```sh
if docker exec -it mysql_container mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e "SELECT 1"; then
```

and also updated `docker-compose.yaml` file, adding the container name:

```yaml
container_name: mysql_container
```

How that new `if` works? It allocates a pseudo-terminal in an interactive mode on a running container (identified by its name, `mysql_container` in this case),
and executes command

`mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e "SELECT 1`.

And ... success! Everything worked as expected. MySQL got up, the DB was ready, tests run and passed, and eventually
docker cleaned up everything.

But I noticed this (expected) error message, which was printed upon each iteration.
It was a bit noisy and not informative (as I did not care that the DB is not ready yet).

```sh
Waiting for MySQL to be ready...
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
```

So I decided to send it into the void (`/dev/null`), resulting in:

```sh
if docker exec -it mysql_container mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e "SELECT 1" > /dev/null; then
```

And now, when I executed `pnpm test` everything was clean and nice:

```sh

(removed logs from runnig tests as it does not matter here)

### Final touches

I also noticed, that I need to repeat the values I use for username, password, host etc.

A nice, and clean, and a flexible way, is to extract those to the environment variables. If you decide,
or are forced, to use different values, you will be able to do so, with a change in one place.

Summarizing, this is the final state of the files I created:

**.env**

```sh
MYSQL_CONTAINER_NAME=mysql_container
MYSQL_DATABASE=database_name
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
MYSQL_PORT=3306
```

**docker-compose.yaml**

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    container_name: ${MYSQL_CONTAINER_NAME}
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    ports:
      - '${MYSQL_PORT}:3306'
```

**run-tests-with-cleanup.sh**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f .env ]; then
    echo "Loading environment variables from .env file..."
    source .env
else
    echo ".env file not found. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Starting MySQL using docker-compose..."
docker-compose up -d mysql

echo "Waiting for MySQL to be ready..."
RETRIES=30                   # Maximum retries before giving up
SLEEP_TIME=2                 # Time to wait between retries

for ((i=1; i<=RETRIES; i++)); do
    if docker exec -it "$MYSQL_CONTAINER_NAME" mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e "SELECT 1" > /dev/null; then
        echo "MySQL is ready!"

        echo "Running tests..."
        vitest run

        echo "Cleaning up Docker containers..."
        docker-compose kill
        docker-compose rm -f
        exit 0
    else
        echo "MySQL is not ready yet. Retrying in $SLEEP_TIME seconds... ($i/$RETRIES)"
        sleep $SLEEP_TIME
    fi
done

# If we reach here, the database never became ready
echo "MySQL did not become ready in time. Cleaning up Docker and exiting."
docker-compose kill
docker-compose rm -f
exit 1
```

Remember to make it executable, if you didn't already: `chmod +x ./run-tests-with-cleanup.sh`.

**package.json** (just the `test` script)

```json
"test": "./run-tests-with-cleanup.sh"
```

And that's all. Enjoy!

## An update

I realized I can make this script be more versatile, by running a command when MySQL is ready, not just unit tests.
Why is that good? Well, because the above implementation does not allow for e.g. running tests in watch mode.

That is why I changed the script to this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f .env ]; then
    echo "Loading environment variables from .env file..."
    source .env
else
    echo ".env file not found. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Starting MySQL using docker-compose..."
docker-compose up -d mysql

echo "Waiting for MySQL to be ready..."
RETRIES=30                   # Maximum retries before giving up
SLEEP_TIME=2                 # Time to wait between retries

for ((i=1; i<=RETRIES; i++)); do
    if docker exec -it "$MYSQL_CONTAINER_NAME" mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" -e "SELECT 1" > /dev/null; then
        echo "MySQL is ready!"

        if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
            echo "Running: $@"

            "$@" 
        fi

        echo "Cleaning up Docker containers..."
        docker-compose kill
        docker-compose rm -f
        exit 0
    else
        echo "MySQL is not ready yet. Retrying in $SLEEP_TIME seconds... ($i/$RETRIES)"
        sleep $SLEEP_TIME
    fi
done

# If we reach here, the database never became ready
echo "MySQL did not become ready in time. Cleaning up Docker and exiting."
docker-compose kill
docker-compose rm -f
exit 1
```

Where `if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then` means: if there are any arguments added to the script, do something.
And that's done here: `"$@"`.

Also, I renamed the script to: `when-mysql-is-ready-run.sh`. And now I can do this in package.json:

```json
"test": "./when-mysql-is-ready-run.sh vitest run",
"test:watch": "./when-mysql-is-ready-run.sh vitest run --watch"
```
