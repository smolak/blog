In the early days of my career as a software developer I did not buy this statement. How hard can it (naming things) be? Little did I know back then.

## Why do we need good names for things?

As you all know, the code is read more often than it is written. And the code is read by humans, not machines.
So, it is essential to write code that is easy to read and to understand.

One of the most important aspects of writing readable code is to use good names for things.
This approach is mostly welcome in Domain Driven Design, where the code should reflect the business domain as closely as possible.
For instance, if you are working on a project that deals with e-commerce, you should use names like `product`, `order`, `customer`, `price`, etc.
Technical nomenclature is also welcome, but it should be used in the right context. And it also should be clear and concise.

One might argue that the name of a variable does not matter as long as it is descriptive enough. Well, that is not entirely true.

In this article I will present some of the problems you might encounter, how to avoid them, and a couple of techniques to create good variable names.

## How a variable name can cause problems?

Let's look at a couple of examples:

1. **Unclear purpose of a variable**

Recently, I worked on a project where we had a property named `price`. It was used in a data structure that represented an advertisement.
The `price` property was supposed to represent the price of the advertisement. However, the context it was used in (an ad for a product on a product shelf) indicated that it was the price of the product, not the advertisement.

Us, the creators of the data, knew what the `price` represented. But the consumers of the data (other parts of the system) did not.
And they assumed that the `price` represented the price of the product it advertised. Luckily, this was caught in a right moment (during visual testing).

Why am I mentioning this?

Imagine we did not catch this mistake in time. The ad would render a tiny price (imagine something like $0.01) instead of the actual price of the product.
This could have caused a loss in revenue for the company, as the users could request a refund for the difference in price.
Loss of trust in the company, loss of revenue, loss of reputation, etc. All because of a bad variable name. Even, if the name was descriptive enough.

How to improve this? Be specific, e.g. use `adPrice` instead of `price`. This way, it is clear that the variable represents the price of the advertisement, not the product.

2. **Unclear unit of a variable**

Let's take a look at a variable named `timeout`. Is it in seconds or milliseconds? This can cause a loss in synchronization, too much or too few data accumulated (over certain period of time), etc.

A very famous example of this is the NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter failure, that happened in 1999.
A navigation error occurred due to software inconsistencies between metric and imperial unit systems. This caused the orbiter to crash into Mars.

While this can be solved by standardization of values, when you can't do it, it's good to mention the unit in the variable name. E.g. `timeoutInSeconds` or `timeoutInMs`.

3. **Lack of variable name**

Lack of variable name can also cause problems. For instance, if you have a magic number or a magic string in your code, it is better to give it a name.

For instance, what does `timeoutInMs(500)` mean? Why 500 and not 400 or some different value?

Instead, introduce a local variable explaining the meaning of that value and use it, e.g. `timeoutInMs(loadingAnimationDuration)`.

4. **Unclear name**

Abbreviations, for instance, can also be a problem. For instance, `u` for a `User` is perhaps not the best choice. Especially if the variable is used in a global context.
There are exceptions. For example, `i` for an index is fine in a small context (e.g. in a loop).

And so on.

## How to create good variable names?

There are several ways to create good variable names. Here are some of them:

### 1. Long to short

When you know what given entity (variable/function/...) is supposed to do, follow those steps:

1. Write the long name, long explanation.
2. Get rid of articles and prepositions (if possible).
3. Optionally, use the nomenclature of the domain (to compress few words into shorter version).

In other words, it is about compressing the full sentence into a single word or a few words.

**For instance:**

- list of images
- images list
- gallery

Or:

- store the result of an expensive function call
- store result of function call
- memoize

### 2. Use the nomenclature of the domain

Instead of creating a new names for things that already have a name in the domain, use the name from the domain.
Also, be specific about them. Add context if need be.

**For instance:**

- `product` instead of `item` (item can be anything, product is specific)
- `withdrawal` instead of `transaction` (transaction can be of any type, withdrawal is specific)
- `customer` instead of `user` (user can be anyone in the company or outside of it, customer is specific)

### 3. Use tests to unravel the name

When you are not sure what the name should be, write tests that will use the variable/function/... and see what it does.
Usually what helps me is to give the unit I am about to test a name like `foo`.
While I add new tests, I begin to see what `foo` does, and this helps me to name it properly. The more cases I add, the
more the name becomes clearer.

## Final words

By investing time in creating good names for things, you will save time in the long run. You will avoid misunderstandings, bugs, and other problems that can arise from bad names.
You will gain better perception (of the codebase) from your colleagues, and yourself, in 6 months.

Everyone will know what the code does just by reading it, without the necessity to jump into implementation details.
That will allow for quicker onboarding of new team members. So on, so forth.

There is one thing you should remember though. You don't have to spend lots of time coming up with perfect names. Just write good enough names.
When you'll revisit the code later, you will see if the name can be improved, and have the chance to do so.
