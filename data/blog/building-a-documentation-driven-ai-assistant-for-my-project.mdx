summary: "How I stopped repeating myself to Cursor by creating organized documentation that it can reference."

## The Problem I Faced

I'm currently porting my project to new technologies (TanStack Start, orpc, Clerk) and found myself constantly explaining the same architectural decisions to Cursor over and over again. Every time I asked for help, I'd have to re-explain my import patterns, component organization, testing strategy, and coding conventions. It was like having a brilliant developer on my team who kept forgetting our project's standards.

## The Lightbulb Moment

Instead of repeating myself constantly, I realized I could teach Cursor once and have it remember everything. But here's the thing—I didn't want to cram all my rules into a single `.cursorrules` file. I wanted something that could grow with my project and stay organized.

So I asked Cursor to help me create a comprehensive documentation system based on the decisions I'd made during our conversations about the project architecture.

## What I Built

Honest truth—I asked Cursor to generate the documentation for me. Based on my old implementation and the decisions I made during our back-and-forth conversations about the new architecture, Cursor helped me create a comprehensive system.

Instead of cramming everything into a single `.cursorrules` file, I created a documentation system that Cursor can reference. This approach lets me maintain detailed, organized rules that grow with my project.

### The Architecture

My `.cursorrules` file is intentionally minimal—it's just a reference system:

```markdown
# Cursor IDE Rules for the project

## Documentation References
- **Quick Reference**: See docs/RULES-INDEX.md for a complete overview
- **Coding Standards**: See docs/CODING-GUIDELINE.md for all coding patterns
- **Architecture**: See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for component organization
- **Design**: See docs/DESIGN.md for user experience specifications

## Rule Sources
All rules are defined in their respective documentation files. This file only references where to find them.
```

### The Documentation System I Created

I organized everything into four focused documents that Cursor can reference:

#### 1. **CODING-GUIDELINE.md** - Development Standards
This captures all the coding patterns I've established:
- **Import Rules**: How I handle imports between packages, apps, and within the same codebase
- **Naming Conventions**: My file naming, variable, and function patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: Where I place tests and what I mock vs. what I test directly
- **Technology Stack**: The specific versions and configurations I'm using
- **Code Style**: My BiomeJS setup and formatting preferences

#### 2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System Design
This documents how I've structured the project:
- **Component Architecture**: How I organize shared vs app-specific components
- **CRUD Hooks Organization**: My single-file pattern for data operations
- **Dependency Management**: How my packages relate to each other
- **Performance Patterns**: Caching and optimization strategies I use

#### 3. **DESIGN.md** - Product Vision
This covers the user experience side:
- **User Flows**: How users will interact with the app
- **Feature Specifications**: What each feature does and why
- **UI Patterns**: My design system and component guidelines
- **Success Metrics**: How I'll measure if the project is working

#### 4. **RULES-INDEX.md** - Quick Reference
A comprehensive index that helps me and Cursor find the right rule quickly:
- **By Task**: "Setting up imports" → points to specific sections
- **By File Type**: "React components" → relevant rules
- **Cross-References**: How different rules relate to each other

### The .cursorcontext File

My `.cursorcontext` provides the high-level project context, covering description, key architectural patterns, technology stack.

## How This Changed My Development Process

### 1. **No More Repetition**
I define my rules once in documentation, and Cursor remembers them. When I update a rule, I update it in one place, and Cursor automatically gets the latest version.

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Instead of trying to fit everything into `.cursorrules`, I can have detailed, well-organized documentation that covers every aspect of my development process.

### 3. **Consistent Code Generation**
Cursor now generates code that follows my patterns automatically. Every component, hook, and utility follows the same conventions I've established.

### 4. **Project Growth**
As my project evolves, I can add new sections to documentation without cluttering the `.cursorrules` file. The system grows with my needs.

### 5. **Better Focus**
I spend less time explaining patterns and more time building features. Cursor understands my project's DNA.

## The Real Impact on My Work

This system has completely transformed how I work on my project. Now when I collaborate with Cursor, it understands my project's patterns and generates code that fits perfectly. Here's what changed:

- **Faster Development**: I spend less time explaining patterns and more time building features
- **Consistent Code**: Everything Cursor generates follows my established conventions
- **Better Focus**: I can focus on logic and architecture instead of style and organization
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Cursor feels like a true project partner who knows my codebase

## What I Learned

If you want to try this approach for your own project:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic `.cursorrules` for your immediate needs
2. **Document Patterns**: As you identify patterns in your work, move them to documentation
3. **Reference System**: Update `.cursorrules` to reference your documentation
4. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on what works for your specific project

## The Bottom Line

For me, `.cursorrules` and `.cursorcontext` became more than configuration files—they became my project's coding DNA. By creating comprehensive documentation that Cursor can reference, I turned it from a helpful tool into a true project partner who understands my project's architecture and follows my conventions.

The key wasn't just having these files, but organizing them in a way that scales with my work. This is not a final system—I'll continue iterating with Cursor to polish and refine these rules as the project evolves.
