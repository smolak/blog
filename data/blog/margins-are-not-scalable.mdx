# margin: 10px

This is a pretty normal CSS styling. Let's imagine we have some element, an image, and we want to give it some breathable
space around. OK, fair. Especially when we render a list of images, we will get them spaced evenly, both horizontally and
vertically.

And that's it. I really can't defend this setting anymore. Let's break it quickly.

## The problem

> Hey, Jacek, let's reuse that component of yours. But, for this list I need 15px space around the images. Can you do it?

Hmm... sure. I'll target the children of the list and set the margin to 15px. Done.

Great, but now I have two margin definitions. One for 10px and one for 15px. Perhaps it's a smell? (yes, it is)

> Hey, Jacek, but ... when the items wrap, the space between them is not consistent. Can you fix it?

OK, different top, different right, different bottom, and for the last element in the row, which I need to
hardcode, nth-child(), or whatever, I need to set negative right, etc. Perhaps not exactly like that, but you get the point.
And now we have 4 settings for margin + the last in the row.

> Hey, Jacek, but ... when we change the width of the container, the space between the items is not consistent. Can you fix it?

... and so on.

## Solution

There is no one solution, but there is one general rule of thumb/guideline:

### Child should not be aware of the parent's layout

Meaning, they, the child elements, should only occupy the space they need, and the parent should take care of the
layout/spacing around them.

Children themselves shouldn't know how they are rendered (space-wise), in what context, etc. They shouldn't even know there
are more children like them. But parents should, and they do, and they should take care of it.

So, instead of all that margin hell, in that particular case, you could use `gap` property, which is a part of the
`flexbox` and `grid` layout. It's a space between the children, and it's consistent, no matter the width of the container,
no matter the number of children, no matter the wrapping, etc.

Then, any element, like the image in our case, is reusable in any context. Such solution is scalable.

> What about paddings? Or borders?

Unless this is supposed to be a part of the design of the element, and reused as such everywhere - yes, it's fine.
Otherwise, it's the same problem. Meaning, you should set the padding for the elements on the list (from the list's
perspective, the context), not for the elements directly.
