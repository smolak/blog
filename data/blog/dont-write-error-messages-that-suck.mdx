# Evolution of an error message

Let's take a look at this error message:

> Something went wrong.

We've all seen it, we've all experienced it. It's poor, it's not helpful, it's not informative, it's not reassuring,
it's not good. It's terrible.

I will try to make it better. But first, let's see what's wrong with it.

_"Something"_ - what is that something? Do I need to know what? The vast majority of the time, yes. If I don't know what
went wrong, I can't fix it.

Let's now look at this from the perspective of a user of a system and the creator of the same system.

### User

Let's say I was paying for a ticket to the movies. I entered my credit card details, clicked "Pay", and then I got this message.
Did my money go through? Did I pay for the ticket? Did I not? I don't know. I have to check my bank account, and so on.
I have to do more work than I should have to. I have to do the work the system should have done for me.

### Programmer

Let's say I was working on a system that was supposed to send an email to the user after they paid for the ticket.
I got this message. What do I do? I have to check the logs. I have to check the code. I have to check the email service.
I have to do more work than I should have to. I have to do the work the system should have done for me.

That sucks.

## Change "something" to something meaningful

> "We could not process the payment."

Better. Now I know what went wrong.

But I still need to check my bank account. I still need to check the logs. I still need to check the code.

Why?

Do I know if the money went through? If so, we charged the customer without giving them the goods they ordered.
If that had happened, this would have been even worse.

And for the programmer?

> "The payment could not be processed. Payment gateway connection timeout."

Better. Now I know what went wrong, and I know where to look. But I still need to check the logs, and I still need to check
the code, because I don't know if the payment went through and the timeout is for the response or if the money did not go in
at all.

## Add reassurance

> "We could not process the payment. Don't worry, you have not been charged."

Better. Now I know what went wrong, and I know that I don't have to check my bank account.
(you could, just to be sure...)

But what do I do now? Do I try again? Do I contact support? Do I give up? Do I still have my reservation?

What about the programmer?

> "The payment could not be processed. Payment gateway connection timeout. The payment has not been processed."

Of course, this can be shortened with some error codes, especially when there are a gazillion of things going on,
but you get the point.

## Add instructions

> "We could not process the payment. Don't worry, you have not been charged. Please try again."

Great. Now I know what went wrong, I know that I don't have to check my bank account, and I know what to do next.

I will skip the programmer's part because the journey of the request is far too complex and goes through many systems.
At this point, the programmer should have enough information to know what to do, and where to look. Most likely there would
be some stack trace or error code that would help them pinpoint the issue. If not, that's a different problem.
Let's focus on the user from now on.

## Can we do better?

Yes, we can.

> "We could not process the payment. Don't worry, you have not been charged. Please try again. If the problem persists,
> contact support."

## Can we do even better?

Yes, of course.

> "We could not process the payment. Don't worry, you have not been charged. Please try again. If the problem persists,
> contact support. Error code: 1234."

## Is that all?

No, it's not.

> "We could not process the payment. Don't worry, you have not been charged. Please try again. If the problem persists,
> contact support. Error code: 1234. Use our chat support for faster response or call us at 123-456-789."

Now the user has all the information they need. They know what went wrong, they know what to do next, they know what to do
if the problem persists, they know what to do if they need help, and they know how to get help faster.

## Conclusion

Error messages are not something to be trivial about. They are important for the user, and they are also important for
the programmer. Remember, happy users are returning users, and happy programmers are productive programmers.
