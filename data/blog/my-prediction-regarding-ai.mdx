# Dangers related to code generation

More and more code is and will be generated by AI. It's already happening. There are tools that can generate code for you.
Like copilot from GitHub. It's not perfect, but it's getting better and better.

Till that happens (it being great), this is what I think will happen:

### ~AI~ People will create lots of tech debt and bugs, and other people will need to fix that.

The reason for that is I see/read/hear more and more about people generating code, blindly, using AI.
Without more verification or refactoring. And, frankly, it's not great. It's not even good. Usually, it's just a code that works.

Here's an example:

<div data-theme="dark">
    <Tweet id="1765089261374914957" />
</div>

Who will maintain this? How readable is this? Can you parse it, in your
head with ease? I can't. And I am a programmer.

People need to understand that AI is not a magic wand. It's a tool. And like any tool, it can be used for good and bad.
Things begin to look like nails right now, because we were given a sledgehammer. And it's used more and more everywhere.

I hope I am wrong, I really do.

I will revisit this post in couple of years and see how it went.
