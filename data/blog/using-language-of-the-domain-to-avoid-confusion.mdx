# Offer, product, shop item

The three could be the same, given some context, but not necessarily.

## Disclaimer

This is not a full-blown description of all the why, what, or how. I will write you what I encountered in one codebase
I was refactoring.

## The problem

One of the assignments I had to tackle included refactoring a part of the code, where a list of products was rendered.
Some business logic was misplaced and had to be moved elsewhere. Anyway, I went to see the tests and I saw something
along those lines:

```tsx
// As I don't have access to the original code,
// this is made up, just to highlight the problem.
it('should render shop items', async () => {
    const products = [...];

    render(<ItemsList items={products} />);

    const renderedProducts = await screen.findByRole('listitem');

    // and so on...
});
```

As you can see, the same thing has a couple of different names. While the generic `ItemsList` component is fine to use,
the rest... Either the description should be changed or the implementation. **The vocabulary, the domain specific language should
be consistent, everywhere**.

When I say product, you know what I mean. When I say shop item, write product, and you read
list item - which one is which? Which word should I use when I speak to the developer, designer, or the domain expert?

**The same, all the time.**

Here's an example of how this code should look like:

```tsx
it('should render products list', async () => {
    const products = [...];

    render(<ProductsList products={products} />);

    // role is fine, as it follows the ARIA specification
    const renderedProducts = await screen.findByRole('listitem');

    // and so on...
});
```

## Conclusion

Don't make people think. Be consistent. Don't reinvent concepts, reuse the ones already defined. The code usually
comes as the last piece. There were discussions, plannings, and decisions made long before that. People coined names or used
the terminology that already describes the domain you work in. Use them. Not sure what to use? Ask around. And so on.

Remember, naming things is hard. Why bother when it's given to you on a plate?
