# Trust nobody

Any incoming data, especially from 3rd parties, must be validated. Depending on the needs and circumstances, it can be
done in a form of a type or a runtime validation, or both. The stronger, the better.

## Example

Let's say we have a REST endpoint with this functionality:

```javascript
// Imagine this is a backend for frontend, and we're fetching the data
// from some other API. The architecture doesn't matter here much.
// `page` comes from pagination params.
export const getProducts = async ({ categoryId, page }) => {
    const products = await httpClient.get(
        `/products?categoryId=${categoryId}&page=${page}`
    );

    // Let's assume we construct a different data type for returned products
    return createProductsList(products);
}
```

There are a couple of problems here:
 - `categoryId` most likely is an enum value, or some unique identifier, of a certain type
    - what if a different type is used?
    - or someone sends megabytes long string, imagine having this in logs? (OK, that's a different problem, but still)
 - `page` is expected to be a number, more precisely, and integer, more precisely a positive (0 included, or not, depends
   on the number the first page will have)

OK, that's a no-brainer.

## But what about the outgoing data?

As you can see from the example above, there's a call to some API being done, from where we fetch the actual data.
Last time I wrote about [explicit return types](explicit-return-types) which would highlight what the public APIs / functions
return. Well, what if they don't have that, or they don't do versioning or whatever else (like human error in development)?
Those things can be hard to find and might not be explicitly logged (or the error messages can suck; I might write about
that as well).

If the structure of the returned data changes, and you use it to compose the returned value, there are few things that can
happen:
 - your application will still work, as you don't rely on the changed data
 - you will get `undefined` for properties that don't exist anymore (**case 1**)
 - you will get a runtime error if you will be reaching deeper to nested properties that don't exist (**case 2**)

Well, that suck, doesn't it?

## Solution

### Use validation at the boundaries of your system.

Let's continue with the above example and add validation where necessary.

I will use a remarkable TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, that I highly recommend - [zod](https://zod.dev).

```typescript
// Typescript this time, for safety during development,
// and a first line of defense - during development.
// `Payload` and `ProductsList` come from zod schemas.
export const getProducts = async (payload: Payload): ProductsList => {
    // Checking the incoming data, at the boundary of our function.
    // Using safeParse to eventually `trim` or alike clean some incoming data
    // before validation.
    const payloadCheck = payloadSchema.safeParse(payload);

    if (!payloadCheck.success) {
        // Throw a generic error or however else you want.
        // Doesn't matter for this example.
        throw new Error(payloadCheck.error);
    }

    // Now we have a guarantee the incoming data is OK.
    const { categoryId, page } = payloadCheck.data;

    // Intentionally use different name, because we don't have a guarantee
    // of it being what we expect.
    const maybeProducts = await httpClient.get(
        `/products?categoryId=${categoryId}&page=${page}`
    );

    // Another boundary - with an external system
    const productsListCheck = productsListSchema.safeParse(maybeProducts);

    if (!productsListCheck.success) {
        throw new Error(productsListCheck.error);
    }

    // Again, we have a guarantee that the data is of correct type.
    // This time we can even drop the additional function, and use
    // zod for data transformation.
    const productsList = productsListCheck.data;

    // And thus the last boundary is also guaranteed to be covered,
    // the outgoing one, which goes for cases 1 and 2.
    return productsList;
}
```

Now this looks more rock-solid.

Stay safe, and validate your data!
