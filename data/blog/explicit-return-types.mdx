## Word about APIs

Good APIs are versioned (whatever _good_ means). And if so, they should (not guaranteed) retain the interface. They
shoudl honor the [open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle): _"software entities
(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"_.
Meaning, if some REST API extends (adds new fields to) the data structure it returns, then this is just an extension,
not a breaking change.

One more thing to remember - such APIs are consumed by third parties. Changing things without versioning can, and will,
result in problems. So it's better to keep to versioning rules, e.g. [semver](https://semver.org). But this post is not
about versioning. The responsibility that comes with breaking changes is. Having that said...

## What about exported functions, public methods?

Let's have a look at this exported function:

```typescript
export const getProducts = async () => {
    // This is an example, not using any well-known client.
    // The generic set is supposed to tell TS that `products` is of type Product[]
    const { products } = await httpClient.get<Product[]>('/products');

    // So that this function returns Promise<Product[]>
    return products;
}
```

This implementation will make the IDE tell us what the return type is, everyone will see it immediately, etc. Cool.

## The problem

What if someone will change it? Let's say, we had to have a pagination data, because of reasons.
This function would look something like this:

```typescript
// The name needs to change as well, bugger
export const getPaginatedProducts = async () => {
    const { products, metadata } = await httpClient.get<Product[]>('/products');
    const paginationData = createPaginationData(metadata);

    return { products, pagination: paginationData };
}
```

Now, that function returns `Promise<{ products: Product[], pagination: PaginationData }>`.
Of course, typescript will see that and will highlight you all the places you need to amend.

But you have introduced a breaking change.

If you work alone on an app, or in a small team, this is not a problem. But if you work in a large codebase, like
a monorepo, and many teams, tens or hundreds of developers work on that codebase, this change can create a cascade of
unwanted work. And that is a major problem.

## Suggested approach

Whenever you will find yourself in a need of changing such a code, this is what you should keep in mind:
 - the return type for the function was designed like that for a reason
 - and as such, won't that break somebody else's implementation?
 - also, do I really want to change this?
 - and if so, am I changing it in a right place?

As we can't version functions (well... sure, perhaps `getProducts2` ;) just kidding), we could make sure the
returned type (as well as the arguments interface) are intact within the open-closed principle boundaries.
That is why I would suggest the following:

### Introduce an explicit return type for all public functions / methods

This will give you the following benefits:
 - keeping you in check - for instance: will I violate [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
   if I add that change?
 - IDE will tell you what parts of the codebase will be affected, before you start implementing the change, giving you
   a cheap and quick way to see if this is a reasonable change and does not affect others in a bad way
 - you will have a TS error till you complete the change to honor the interface, and will tell you when you're done; think
   of it as a constant feedback loop
 - you could spot a [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) which might lead you to a better implementation
 - explicit, readable returned interface, one that anyone can inspect (vs implicit one, e.g. from yet another function
   call)
 - and so on...
