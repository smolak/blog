# Introduction

Not so long ago I was responsible for creating a client for a backend service (component, a chunk of code).
The client was meant to be simple: some configuration and a single public method on it. Although the task seemed to be
trivial, I decided to take a bit more effort to try something I haven't done in a while. Test Driven Development (TDD).
But with little to no implementation. Why? To have a set of tests, showing how it would look like in order to present it
to the actual users of the client for an early verification of the idea.

## Why TDD?

Before I jump in there, there is one thing you need to remember:

**TDD is a design strategy**

Yes, you use it to create tests. Yes, you use it to create tests first, implementation later. But the main thing is that
you use it to become the very first user of the thing you're about to build.

Let's take a step back. In order to create a piece of code that you'd enjoy using, or find it intuitive,
well... you need to use it first to find out if it really is like that.

In a regular software development there is this cycle:

 - you create something and let it out
 - your users use it and give you feedback
 - you listen (hopefully), make changes, release again
 - ... and the cycle repeats itself

With TDD it's the same, but you are all of the actors.

## The work

Like I wrote, I was tasked to build the client and therefore **design** its API. For that I created a test suite
and began adding stuff to it. I started asking myself:

 - how would I like to have the client to be used?
 - do I need to pass any configuration to it?
    - probably some, but not now
    - I'll figure that out once I will need it (cool, no premature implementation of things I might not use)
 - perhaps if I started with the business requirements it would become a good first test code implementation?
    - what are the requirements? Ah, to fetch ... (insert whatever data you'd like to fetch from a service)

And so I began. I was using TypeScript (although, probably vanilla JavaScript would be better, later on that).
I went with creating an instance of a yet non-existing class and calling a method on it. Oh, and a proper description
for the test itself. Something along those lines: `getX method returns a collection of X`. Sounds trivial? Good, it will
be trivial to whomever will read it.

Was it a good idea to go with a class? I did not know yet. It was OK.

Later I created the implementation of the class, with that method, returning nothing. Here's why I believe JS would be
easier to use. Everytime I changed something, I had to adjust the interface or the fake returned data. Yes, you could
take shortcuts using `as ...`. But not always.

The business requirements mentioned that the items fetched should be specific for a user.

 - how do I pass the identifier for a user?
 - can I safely use some ID or approach this differently (Auth header with JWT token)?

Some investigation later I knew the answers and used `userId` on the method. Adjusted the description, the test and the
implementation. In that order.

OK, I won't bore you with all the details. tl;dr - I did repeat the steps until all the product requirements were covered.
I followed the cycle, till I was satisfied with the API, the names of things, the way input / output data was sent, etc.

## Presentation

After things were completed, I introduced the proposal for this client to the actual users in a form of a code in repository.
And the rest is history.

One thing to mention is that our team would be the owner for the client, and we had the final say. That is why the tests
would not go to waste. And even if they did, all they were was just a description and examples of the proposed implementation.
Imagine creating the whole thing and then finding out that it's a piece of crap. What a waste that would be.

## Final thoughts

TDD, as a test first technique, helped me picture what I wanted as a user. I wasn't sure if things were good immediately,
but I wasn't worrying too much, as I refactored as I went on. The most important thing was that I could _try out_ the
client, before I even began writing any implementation. Product description / acceptance criteria helped as well, with
the wording / nomenclature. This is important - you should use the language of the domain. Perhaps I will write a separate
blog post about that.
