# Wild, wild west

Let's agree, JS/TS ecosystem is a mess and there is no consistency. There are many ways to do the same thing, and it's
hard to find the best one. On top of that, there are very few standards and best practices.
Or modules that work together through interfaces (not concrete implementations). And I am not talking about the language
itself.

## Moving forward through collaboration and standards

This is the motto (my guess) that accompanies one initiative in the PHP community. It's called [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/).

The PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG) is a group of people who are trying to standardize the way PHP is used in
different projects. They are creating standards for things like coding style, autoloading, and interfaces.

Thanks to them we have interoperability between different PHP projects. We can use libraries from different vendors
without worrying about how they are implemented. We can be sure that they will work together.

## What about TypeScript?

Well, a picture is worth a thousand words:

<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  ![We can do this in TS meme](/static/images/we-can-do-this-in-ts-meme.png)
</div>

According to my current knowledge there is no such thing ðŸ˜ž I wish there was.

I know JS/TS is not that heavily class-based like PHP. There are a lot of modules that are built around functions.
And that's OK. To clarify things, by interface I don't explicitly mean the class' interface, but same function names,
same method names, same arguments and their order, and same return types.

**Wouldn't it be great if:**

- all http clients would implement the same interface?
- all styling libraries would implement the same interface?
- all state management libraries would implement the same interface?
- all form libraries would implement the same interface?
- ...
- all of them would behave and return the same types?

I believe it would. And I believe it would be a great thing for the community. It would make the ecosystem more
consistent and predictable.
