## What is **stash-it**?

**stash-it** is a key-value storage library, written in TypeScript. Its aim is to have a simple API, be flexible, and to be easily extendable.

The idea behind this library appeared when I was looking for a module to cache some data, in any storage, with possibility to add tags and being able to set ttl.
Searching through npm, I found a couple of libraries that were close to what I needed, but none of them had all the features I wanted.
They were either missing something, or were too complex. Long story short, I decided to create my own.

## How does it work?

Let's have a look at a simple example:

```ts
// 1. Import the main class.
import { StashIt } from '@stash-it/stash-it'

// 2. Import an adapter. For this example, let's use the memory adapter.
import { MemoryAdapter } from '@stash-it/memory-adapter'

// 3. Stitch them together.
const stash = new StashIt(new MemoryAdapter())

// 4. Use it.
await stash.setItem('key', 'value')

const item = await stash.getItem('key')

console.log(item.value) // 'value'
```

That's it. You have stored a value in memory and retrieved it.

## What makes it stand out?

You are not bound to a single storage. You can use any storage you want. And you can create your own adapter,
if you want to use a storage that is not supported yet. As all adapters share the same interface, you can also
easily change the storage with little to no code change.

**stash-it** is also built around the concept of hooking into the lifecycle of available methods. This allows you to modify the
data before it is stored, or after it is retrieved. To do that, you create (or use existing) plugins.

This makes it very flexible and extendable. You need some additional functionality? Add it through a plugin.

In order to understand this, let's have a look how a lifecycle of **stash-it**'s methods looks like.

## Lifecycle of methods

There are a handful of methods that **stash-it** exposes. They are:

- `buildKey`
- `setItem`
- `getItem`
- `hasItem`
- `removeItem`
- `setExtra`
- `getExtra`

Each of these can be hooked into.

<aside className="rounded bg-gray-50 px-5 py-0.5 dark:bg-gray-800">
  What is this `extra`? It's an _extra_ data you can set on the item. E.g. to store tags for the
  item, or ttl data. (For more information about the interfaces and types, please head out to the
  [docs](https://jsr.io/@stash-it) and look out for new posts that will cover the topic)
</aside>

Each method, when called, goes through a series of steps. These steps are:

1. **Before hook** - this is the first step. It is called before the actual method on the adapter is executed. This is the
   modification part before the data is stored/retrieved/...
2. **Adapter method call** - step when adapter method (set, get, ... ) is called and persists/read/... the data in the storage.
3. **After hook** - it is called after the method on the adapter is executed. This is the second modification part, after the
   data is stored/retrieved/...
4. **Data is returned** - the result of after hook call.

Let's examine `setItem` method:

```ts
// Here is a simplified version of the source-code of this method, to explain the flow.
// The actual source-code is a bit more complex, but the idea is the same.
class StashIt {
  async setItem(key, value) {
    // 1.
    const beforeSetItemData = await this.#call('beforeSetItem', {
      adapter: this.#adapter,
      key,
      value,
    })

    // 2.
    const itemSet = await this.#adapter.setItem(
      await this.buildKey(beforeSetItemData.key),
      beforeSetItemData.value
    )

    // 3.
    const afterSetItemData = await this.#call('afterSetItem', {
      adapter: this.#adapter,
      ...beforeSetItemData,
      item: itemSet,
    })

    // 4.
    return afterSetItemData.item
  }
}
```

Let's dive in little bit deeper.

### 1. `beforeSetItem` hook

`setItem` method passes the arguments it gets to registered handlers for `beforeSetItem` hook.

Each handler can modify the data, or even stop the execution of the method. As the instance of the adapter is also passed
to the handler, it can be used to read/write data from/to the storage as well.

If there are no handlers, the data is passed, as is, to the next step.

### 2. Adapter method call

Adapter is called with the data that was passed to it from the result of passing it through the `beforeSetItem` hook.
This is when the actual data is stored in the storage. The result of this call is passed to the next step.

It uses `buildKey` method to build the key - one that can be hooked into as well.
Useful in cases when you want to check the key before building it, prefix or suffix it, or even change it completely.
Later on that.

### 3. `afterSetItem` hook

**stash-it** now passes the data to registered (if any) handlers for `afterSetItem` hook. Again, each handler can modify the data, or stop the execution of the method.
And again, handlers can use the adapter instance to read/write data from/to the storage.

Running the data through handlers, returns the data that will be finally returned from the `setItem` method call, what happens
in the final, fourth step.

### 4. Data is returned

As `setItem` method expects to return the item created, it returns it in the end.

This concludes the lifecycle of the `setItem` method.

And where do those handlers come from? They come from **plugins**.

## Plugins

Plugins are the means to extend the functionality of **stash-it**. Right now, you can only create handlers (in plugins) that hook into the
lifecycle of all methods.

Enough talk, let's create one.

### Creating a plugin

Let's imagine **stash-it** is used widely in an application, and other developers are using it as well.
And everyone shares the same storage, what is not unusual. That means, if someone stores a value under a key
that you are using, you might get unexpected results.

**Solution:** allow for namespacing the keys. Or in other words, prefixing the keys with a unique string.

Let's create a plugin that does just that.

```ts
const createPrefixPlugin = (prefix: string) => {
  // Add input validation here, omitted for the sake of simplicity
  return {
    hookHandlers: {
      // Key used by the adapter comes from the `buildKey` method,
      // so we're hooking into this method to prefix it
      buildKey: async ({ key }) => ({ key: `${prefix}-${key}` }),

      // Setting an item returns the item as a result,
      // hence we need to strip the prefix before we do that
      afterSetItem: async (args) => ({
        ...args,
        item: { ...args.item, key: args.item.key.replace(`${prefix}-`, '') },
      }),

      // Same goes for getting an item
      afterGetItem: async (args) => {
        // Remember, item might not exist
        if (args.item) {
          return {
            ...args,
            item: { ...args.item, key: args.item.key.replace(`${prefix}-`, '') },
          }
        }

        return args
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Now, if two teams use **stash-it** and the same storage, they can use this plugin to avoid key collisions (in the storage),
but at the same time, use the non-prefixed keys in their code:

```ts
// One part of the application
const stash1 = new StashIt(new AdapterThatSharesStorage())
const prefixPlugin1 = createPrefixPlugin('team1')
stash1.registerPlugins([prefixPlugin1])

// Another part of the application
const stash2 = new StashIt(new AdapterThatSharesStorage())
const prefixPlugin2 = createPrefixPlugin('team2')
stash2.registerPlugins([prefixPlugin2])

// Now, both teams can use the same storage without worrying about key collisions.
// Also, they can use the same keys, as they are prefixed with a unique string.
// And the items returned have keys stripped of that prefix. Magic! ;)

await stash1.setItem('key', 'value1') // stored under 'team1-key'
await stash2.setItem('key', 'value2') // stored under 'team2-key'

const item1 = await stash1.getItem('key')
const item2 = await stash2.getItem('key')

console.log(item1.value === item2.value) // false
console.log(item1.value, item2.value) // value1, value2
console.log(item1.key, item2.key) // key, key

await stash1.removeItem('key')

await stash1.hasItem('key') // false
await stash2.hasItem('key') // true
```

This is a very brief introduction to **stash-it**. But it hopefully gives you an idea of what it is and how it works.

## Try it out!

The project is still in its early stages, but the core functionality is there. There is no version 1.0.0 yet. For that I need
your input, so, please start using it!

The project is hosted on [jsr](https://jsr.io) with possibility to be installed through npm, bun, pnpm, and alike.

There are already several adapters and plugins written for it, and more are coming. And some dev tools as well. At the time of writing this, there are:

### Main class:

- [@stash-it/stash-it](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/stash-it)

### Adapters:

- [@stash-it/memory-adapter](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/memory-adapter)
- [@stash-it/sqlite-adapter](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/sqlite-adapter)
- [@stash-it/redis-adapter](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/redis-adapter)

### Plugins:

- [@stash-it/prefix-suffix-plugin](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/prefix-suffix-plugin)
- [@stash-it/ttl-plugin](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/ttl-plugin)

### Tools:

- [@stash-it/dev-tools](https://jsr.io/@stash-it/dev-tools)

In the future, I will be sharing more info about the project, and how to use it.
Like, how to create an adapter, develop a plugin, or deep diving into other parts of the library.

So, stay tuned!
