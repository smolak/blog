## Context

In one of the projects, the component we were working on was supposed to log some things, but only on production.
So we had to pass it some information about that environment. We thought `isProduction` was fine, for now.

```typescript jsx
<Component isProduction />
```

Since logging was an internal part, not something someone should control from the outside, we thought it was fine to have it
implemented like this.

But then there was a doubt: what if we wanted to log in some other environments? Or in a different way? E.g. on staging
we would log everything, but on production, we would log only errors.

There was a proposal to have environmental-specific properties being passed to the component depending on the environment
the component was used in. So, for example:

```typescript jsx
// Staging
<Component isStaging />

// Production
<Component isProduction />

// and so on
```

Then I raised a question: what is stopping someone from using both `isStaging` and `isProduction` at the same time?
And, what if we will have more environments in the future to support?

## Proposal

The proposal was to still keep the separate properties, but make them mutually exclusive. So, if `isStaging` is set,
`isProduction` would be ignored. And vice versa. And there would be some strategy to handle this.

But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was a bad idea. **It's a bad design.**

Why? Because it's not clear when:
 - both are set
 - none is set
 - both are set to `true`
 - both are set to `false`

And now add more combinations for more environments.

Sure, you can get some very smart TypeScript to help you with that, but it's not about the code. It's about the
interface. It's about the API.

You also need to take into account that the component might be used in different ways, and by different people.
For instance, the boolean properties can be dynamically set based on some conditions. And you can't control that other
than in runtime. And that is already too late.

## What if?

But if this is about logging, why not just pass the logging strategy to the component? Like, `shouldLog`?

No, this has been already decided upon. That functionality should not be controlled from the outside. What if we log too much
on production, where the traffic is high? What if we log too little on staging, where we need to debug things?

But let's say we do. How do we tell the component what we want to log? We can pass e.g. `logLevel`, but what if that is
not enough and there is more logic to it. The component's API will grow and grow and grow. Sure, we can put all that configuration
in an object and pass it as a single property, but it's just a workaround. It's not a solution.

## Proposed solution

The solution was to have a single property, `environment`, that would accept a string. Then the component would
decide what to do based on that string. The `environment` property value could decide what to log, how to log, and when to log.
And could control more things we would need to implement based on the environment, as well as new ones in the future.
A scalable solution.

You can ask, but what if we already have a logger interface? Then provide additional `logger` property, but keep the
`environment` property, to call the right method on the logger.

## What if?

There is one more thing to consider (well, there are probably more, but this is not an ultimate guide to good component
API design).

What if someone passes a wrong `environment` value? What if someone passes an empty string? What if someone passes a string
that is not supported?

Nothing. Or something. Depends on the business needs. We can validate and react accordingly. Or, since we want to log
only on production and staging, we can just ignore anything that is neither `production`, nor `staging`. Simple as that.

## Conclusion

The API of a component is important. It's not just about the code. It's about the interface. It's about the developer experience,
the maintainability, the scalability. And about not introducing breaking changes.

On the other hand, don't do too abstract APIs. Don't over-engineer. Don't make it too complex. Don't make it too simple.
